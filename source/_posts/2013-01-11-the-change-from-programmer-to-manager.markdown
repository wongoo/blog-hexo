As a programmer, I used to try to resolve problems by myself. But it's not a good habit for a manager, and will confuse the work especially at a busy time. A manager must learn how to assign work to his team. First, make clear for the work or problem; Second, make a plan and add it into your work list;Third, assign work to others and tell them the target and direction; Fourth, keep following the progress of all work on your work list.

A manager has the duty to train new people. It's important to assign some basic and simple work to them. They need chances to learn and grow up. Taking some time to tell them how to do will save your more when they become experienced and could do lots of work for you.
